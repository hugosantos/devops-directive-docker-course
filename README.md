To run this example with Namespace, head over to:

- https://namespace.so/docs/getting-started

And download `ns`.

After you have `ns`:

- `git clone github.com/hugosantos/devops-directive-docker-course`
- `cd devops-directive-docker-course`

Then prepare a local environment with:
```ns prepare local```

This only needs to be done once.
  
And then finally:

```
ns dev 05-example-web-application/client-react
```

After the servers are built and deployed, head over to:

http://client-react-f7hoirn4udg5960b.dev.nslocal.host:40080/
